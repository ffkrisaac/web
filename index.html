        <h3>Hello.</h3>
        <p class="intro">I am Fikri Ishak. I like to explore new things especially in computer and electronics field. A boring person,
           8 - 5 working man and usually spend my after-works and entire weekends on either programming language, web-development or
           embedded system. My dream is to share my knowledge to many people so that tomorrow in the future, there will be more people
           contributing in this open-source world, A better future for everyone.</p>

          <h4>Embedded System</h4>
          <p class="skill-description">I studied Electronics in the Japan-Malaysia Technical Institute. I've spend my 3 years there,
            2.5 of training and half-year of internship. Since then, I gained a lot of technical knowledge for-instance PCB Designing, PLC Programming, 3D-Printing, Troubleshooting etc., but nothings
            that I love more than the development of embedded system. Using basic microcontroller such as Arduino, has really shown me a glimpse of
            future new era of electronics and computer. Thanks to my friends and lecturers, many
            <a class="arduino-developer" href="https://forum.arduino.cc/">Arduino programmers</a>
            and developers around the world, I've managed to finish three projects, including my final-year project. Currently,
            I'm exploring various types of microcontroller and studying their behaviour, advantages and disadvantages.</p>

          <h4>Programming Languages</h4>
          <p class="skill-description">Coding is the most essential part of being a computer programmer. I'm taught to code in
            basic C during my secondary years. I've learned C#, C++, Python in my college. During my freetime, I will enhance my programming languages
            or start to learn other languages. Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience in other programming languages and
            I would like to develop my own mobile applications, games and software.</p>

          <h4>Web Development</h4>
          <p class="skill-description">I started learning to create website after I finished my Diploma because I wanted to make my own website.
          At-present, I have taken Web Development courses on various online learning platform.</p>

          <h4>Electronic Keyboard</h4>
          <p class="skill-description">Whenever I feel like there's no solution when I'm coding or working on something, I take a step
            back to relax by playing my electronic keyboard and sometimes brewing a cup of wonderful coffee. I like to play "To Love's End".</p>
